### Purpose of Software

The software is a guide to help users decide how to dress for the weather. Using a set of questions which the user will give input to, the program will assess whether the day is nice and if the user will need a jacket.

### Installation 

Donwload the software from the github repository. From there, you can run it using any program that runs Python programs.

### How it Works 

The program takes input through code 

```python
isSunny = bool(input("is it sunny outside today?"))
isWarm = bool(input("Is it warm outside?"))
isWindy = bool(input("Is it windy?")) 
```

If the answer to these questions is yes, the user will enter "true" while if the answer is no, the user will enter "false". 

The code will use this input to calculate whether it is considered a nice day and if the user should be advised to bring a jacket or dress warmly.
